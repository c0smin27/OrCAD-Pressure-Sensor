## Circuit for pressure control in a hyperbaric chamber

**Information and constraints for the circuit** <br>

Design a pressure control system in a hyperbaric chamber. Knowing that the pressure sensor used can measure pressure linearly in the range 1050-1530 [mBar], the system will be designed so that the pressure in the hyperbaric chamber is maintained in the range 1200-1400 [mBar]. The pressure sensor will be biased into the current. The linear variation of the electrical resistance of the sensor with pressure is 20k-25k [ohm] and must be converted to a voltage variation in the range [0V - 12V] where Vcc = 14[V]. In the hyperbaric chamber, the pressure is maintained in the specified range by means of a pump, controlled by a comparator and an electromagnetic relay. The pump-relay assembly will be modelled using a resistor. The pump status (on/off) is signalled by a blue LED.
